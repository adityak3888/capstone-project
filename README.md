## 🧩 Layout & CSS Techniques

- **Flexbox** – header alignment, footer, contact two-column layout.
- **CSS Grid** – categories, course cards, testimonials and pricing cards.
- **Responsive design** using media queries:
  - Mobile: up to `768px` (single column, stacked header).
  - Tablet: from `768px` (two-column hero, two-column contact).
  - Desktop: from `1024px` (comfortable spacing and larger layout).
- **Relative units** (`rem`, `%`, `vw`) for fonts and spacing.
- **Hover effects + transitions** on buttons, cards, navigation and social icons.
- **Keyframe animation** on the hero image (gentle floating) and hero heading fade-in.
- CSS custom properties (`:root`) for colors, spacing and shadows.
